**The Soul of A New Machine**, by *Tracy Kidder*

“Computers are irrelevant.”

---

I was lying in West’s guest bedroom very late one night. His wife and two daughters had turned in long ago. On the perimeter of sleep, I heard West out in the living room take up his guitar and sing. He sounded rusty, but his voice, a tenor, could carry a tune nicely. He did not sing the sorts of songs that I gathered he played currently with his friends at their jam sessions, but once-popular folk songs—“The Banks of the O-hi-o” and the like. Those are seductive ballads. If you listen to them long enough, you can start believing that your way in life is strewn with possibilities.

A general feeling has held throughout: that these machines constitute something special, set apart from all the others that have come before. Maybe it has been a kind of chronocentrism, a conviction that the new machines of your own age must rank as the most stupendous or the scariest ever; but whatever the source, computers have acquired great mystique. Almost every commentator has assured the public that the computer is bringing on a revolution. By the 1970s it should have been clear that revolution was the wrong word. And it should not have been surprising to anyone that in many cases the technology

had served as a prop to the status quo. The enchantment seemed enduring, nevertheless. So did many of the old arguments.

---

Sitting there, observing the more familiar chaos of a New York City street, I was struck by how unnoticeable the computer revolution was.

---

Computers had become less noticeable as they had become smaller, more reliable, more efficient, and more numerous.

---

Computers have changed ideas about waging war and about pursuing science, too.

---

Computers probably did not create the growth of conglomerates and multinational corporations, but they certainly have abetted it. They make fine tools for the centralization of power, if that’s what those who buy them want to do with them. They are handy greed-extenders.

---

Presumably the stonemasons who raised the cathedrals worked only partly for their pay. They were building temples to God. It was the sort of work that gave meaning to life. That’s what West and his team of engineers were looking for, I think.

---

Norbert Weiner prophesied that the computer would offer “unbounded possibilities for good and for evil,” and he advanced, faintly, the hope that the contributors to this new science would nudge it in a humane direction.

---

But he also invoked the fear that its development would fall “into the hands of the most irresponsible and venal of our engineers.”

---

What a way to design a computer! “There’s no grand design,” thinks Rosen. “People are just reaching out in the dark, touching hands.”

---

On the Magic Marker board in his office, West wrote the following: Not Everything Worth Doing Is Worth Doing Well. Asked for a translation, he smiled and said, “If you can do a quick-and-dirty job and it works, do it.”

---

“Well, I guess the only good strategy is one that no one else understands.”

---

the technology of computers changes constantly; every year it’s a struggle to keep up with the youngsters fresh out of school.

---

Such games of logic, especially if they are played in a hurry—while flying upside down—can take a grip on an engineer’s thoughts and hold on. After playing this way for a while, you look at a tree and, aha, it is clear that a tree is much like a computer; and a road with side streets is—what else?—a kind of computer program. Chuck Holland said that this unpleasant sensation, of being locked inside the machine, usually lingered three days—on the rare occasion when he got away from the basement for that long.

---

As Rasala himself observed much later on: “With Tom, it’s the last two percent that counts. What I now call ‘the ability to ship product’—to get it out the door.” Rasala looked at me squarely. “And I may not be the smartest designer in the world, a CPU giant, but I’m dumb enough to stick with it to the end.”

---

“Sure. There’s always a way to kill a computer.” “We should build a trap that’ll let us in, for fun, at the end.” “That’s a nice concept, leaving a trapdoor for later, but a real purist would want to get into a machine built by someone else.” “Well, there aren’t too many machines in this place that we can’t control.” “What does it mean to understand a computer?” I inquired. “Knowing where all the electrons go?” “Maybe the electrons aren’t in the computer at all. They just turn on the lights.”

---

Firth had spent about three months getting all the concepts behind his simulator straight, and he actually wrote the program in about a month. The rest of the time he spent on refinements. He could write two hundred to three hundred lines of code in his mind, but he had a hard time remembering his own phone number.

---

One evening that winter I said to him that I didn’t think it was really possible to be a businessman and a dropout all at once. West said, “But I do it.”

---

On posts and basement windowsills were tacked-up aphorisms, mementos and photographs. One card read: “The appreciation of pleasing decay is an important one because it is so often neglected.” It’s Easy To Do It Yourself, said another placard. A hand-lettered wooden sign read: GROUND BONE FOR SALE. A button reminded you that there had been a “Great Boston Kite Festival.” A small photograph showed a robed figure astride a camel in a desert. “What’s this?” a visitor asks, and West pounces: “The first known picture of Jesus Christ,” he says.

---

West often talked about building the “right” machine. He meant “right” in the commercial sense, emphatically.

---

“I think I wanted to see how complicated things happen,” West said years later. “There’s some notion of control, it seems to me, that you can derive in a world full of confusion if you at least understand how things get put together. Even if you can’t under stand every little part, how infernal machines get put together.”

---

none of the Boston papers bothered to point out that the many universities and institutes of technology, existing tax free in Massachusetts, had produced much of the technology and many of the technologists that had made a Data General possible in the first place.

---

It was an expansion of the mind to have a computer.”

---

Some notion of how shrewd they could be is perhaps revealed in the fact that they never tried to hoard a majority of the stock, but used it instead as a tool for growth. Many young entrepreneurs, confusing ownership with control, can’t bring themselves to do this.

---

it is a fact, not entirely lost on management consultants, that some people would rather work twelve hours a day of their own choosing than eight that are prescribed. Provided, of course, that the work is interesting. That was the main thing.

One of Alsing’s Microkids had programmed Trixie to deliver these impertinent responses. In a real sense, Alsing was conversing with a member of his team.
